# lrsql

_lrsql (LER-skw…ôl) - The Learning Record Structured Query Language_

A SQL-based Learning Record Store.

## Overview

A Learning Record Store (LRS) is a persistent store for xAPI statements and associated attachments and documents. The full LRS specification can be found in [Part 3 of the xAPI specification](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#partthree). lrsql is distinct from other LRSs developed at Yet Analytics for being SQL-based and supporting multiple SQL database management systems (DBMSs) like H2, SQLite, and PostgreSQL.

Currently, lrsql is installed by pulling the latest commit from its GitHub repo. In the future it will be available as a closed-source software download available via the purchase of a license.

To use lrsql, a user needs to be authorized by an admin. Admin accounts can be created using special RESTful HTTP methods (described later in the README); logging into them will return a JSON Web Token (JWT), a temporary token that can then be used to create or access lrsql credentials. These credentials, which consist of a public API key (the "username"), a secret API key (the "password"), and their scopes ([described in the xAPI spec](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#42-oauth-10-authorization-scope)), are then used as headers for LRS-specific methods to authenticate and authorize the request sender.

## Environment Variables

### Database

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LRSQL_DB_TYPE` | The DBMS that lrsql will use. Currently supports `h2:mem`, `h2`, `sqlite`, `postgres`, and `postgresql`. The default value used depends on the `main` entry point used, e.g. `lrsql.sqlite.main` will use `sqlite` by default, so overriding the default is **not** recommended. | Varies |
| `LRSQL_DB_NAME` | The name of the database. | `example` |
| `LRSQL_DB_HOST` | The host that the database will run on. Not supported by in-mem H2 or SQLite. | `localhost` |
| `LRSQL_DB_PORT` | The port that the database will run on. Not supported by in-mem H2 or SQLite. | `9001` (H2), `5432` (PG) |
| `LRSQL_DB_PROPERTIES` | Optional additional database properties. Must be a string of comma-separated `key:value` pairs if set. Supported properties will depend on the DBMS. | Not set |
| `LRSQL_DB_JDBC_URL` | Optional JDBC URL; this will override the above properties if set. URL syntax will depend on the DBMS. | Not set |
| `LRSQL_DB_USER` | The DB user. Optional. | Not set |
| `LRSQL_DB_PASSWORD` | The DB password. Optional. | Not set |

### Connection

The following environment variables are aliases for c3p0 properties, each of which has their respective link to the c3p0 documentation. All of these variables are optional and are not set by default (in which case c3p0 uses its own default values).

| Variable | c3p0 Property |
| --- | --- |
| `LRSQL_POOL_INIT_SIZE` | [initialPoolSize](https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#initialPoolSize) |
| `LRSQL_POOL_MIN_SIZE` | [minPoolSize](https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#minPoolSize) |
| `LRSQL_POOL_INC` | [acquireIncrement](https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#acquireIncrement) |
| `LRSQL_POOL_MAX_SIZE` | [maxPoolSize](https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#maxPoolSize) |
| `LRSQL_POOL_MAX_STMTS` | [maxStatements](https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#maxStatements) |

### LRS

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LRSQL_SEED_API_KEY` | The public API key that seeds the credential table, ie. added to the table upon initialization. Optional and primarily used for testing and development. | Not set |
| `LRSQL_SEED_API_SECRET` | The secret API key that seeds the credential table, ie. added to the table upon initialization. Optional and primarily used for testing and development. | Not set |
| `LRSQL_STMT_MORE_URL_PREFIX` | A string that prefixes the fragment in the `more` URL returned by a multi-statement query. | Empty string |
| `LRSQL_STMT_GET_DEFAULT` | The default `limit` value in a statement query. Queries default to this value if not explicitly set. | `50` | 
| `LRSQL_STMT_GET_MAX` | The maximum allowed `limit` value for a statement query. If an explicit `limit` value exceeds this value, it will be overridden. | `50` |

### Webserver

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LRSQL_KEY_FILE` | The path to the Java Keystore file that contains the key pair and credentials, which are used for HTTPS as well as JWT signing and verification. | `config/keystore.jks` |
| `LRSQL_KEY_ALIAS` | The alias of the private key. | `lrsql_keystore` |
| `LRSQL_KEY_PASSWORD` | The password protecting the keystore. **It is highly recommended that you override the default value.** | `lrsql_pass` |

| `LRSQL_JWT_EXP_TIME` | The amount of time, in seconds, after a JWT is created when it expires. Since JWTs are not revocable, **this this time should be short** (i.e. one hour or less). | `3600` (one hour) |
| `LRSQL_JWT_EXP_LEEWAY` | The amount of time, in seconds, before or after the expiration instant when a JWT should still count as un-expired. Used to compensate for clock desync. | `1` (one second) |
| `LRSQL_ENABLE_HTTP` | Whether HTTP is enabled or not (as opposed to HTTPS, which is always enabled). | `true` |
| `LRSQL_ENABLE_HTTP2` | Whether HTTP/2 is supported or not. | `true` |
| `LRSQL_HTTP_HOST` | The host that the webserver will run on. | `0.0.0.0` (localhost) |
| `LRSQL_HTTP_PORT` | The HTTP port that the webserver will be open on. | `8080` |
| `LRSQL_SSL_PORT` | The HTTPS port that the webserver will be open on. | `8443` |

## Makefile Targets

| Target | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ci` | Called when running continuous integration; runs all test cases. |
| `keystore` | Alias for the `config/keystore.jks`, which generates a Java Keystore file with the default alias, password, and file path, as well as a self-signed certificates. This is called during CI and is not recommended for keystore generation in production. |
| `ephemeral` | Makes an in-memory H2 database with the seed API key `username` and seed API secret `password`. This can then be used during development to test/bench lrsql functionality. |
| `persistent` | Similar to `ephemeral`, except that the H2 DB is stored on-disk, not in-memory.

## REST API

The HTTP methods that are LRS-specific are given in [the xAPI spec](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#datatransfer). Requests to the LRS (which are denoted by the `xapi` path prefix) must contain a Base64 encoded, colon-separated public and secret API key pair in the `authorization` field of the header. For example (assuming `http://example` is the URL body), `http://example.org/xapi/statements` is the URL at which the user inserts and queries xAPI statements; other URLs are used to insert and query documents, agents, and activities.

In addition to the LRS HTTP methods, lrsql supports methods for admin account creation, login, and use; these methods are denoted by the `admin` path prefix.

### Admin Account Routes

The following examples use `http://example.org` as the URL body. All methods require that the request body is a JSON object that contains `username` and `password` string values; otherwise, a `400 BAD REQUEST` response is returned. All methods return `200 OK` on success.

- `POST http://example.org/admin/account/create`: Create a new admin account. The response body contains a newly generated JSON Web Token on success. Returns a `400` error if the request body parameters are invalid, or a `409 CONFLICT` error if the account already exists.
- `POST http://example.org/admin/account/login`: Log into an existing account. The response body contains a newly generated JSON Web Token on success. A `404 NOT FOUND` error is returned if the account does not exist, or a `401 FORBIDDEN` error if the password is incorrect.
- `DELETE http://example.org/admin/account`: Delete an existing account. The response body is a message that says `"Successfully deleted account [username]"` on success. Returns a `404 NOT FOUND` error if the account does not exist, or a `401 FORBIDDEN` error if the password is incorrect.gi

### Admin Credential Routes

The following examples use `http://example.org` as the URL body. All methods require that the `authorization` header value is a valid JSON Web Token generated by account creation or login. All methods return a `401 FORBIDDEN` error if the JWT has expired, or a `400 BAD REQUEST` error if the JWT is otherwise invalid. All methods also require that the request body is a JSON object, though the permitted values depend on the route; otherwise, a `400 BAD REQUEST` error is returned.

- `POST http://example.org/creds`: Create a new credential pair, with the specified scope values given by the `scopes` property in the request body.
- `PUT http://example.org/creds`: Update an existing credential pair, given by `api-key` and `secret-key` properties in the request body, with the new scopes given by the `scopes` property.
- `GET http://example.org/creds`: Read all credential pairs and their associated scopes for a particular account (denoted by the JWT).
- `DELETE http://example.org/creds`: Delete an existing credential pair, given by the `api-key` and `secret-key` properties in the request body, as well as any associated scopes.

## TLS/HTTPS

lrsql will attempt to access certificates used for both HTTPS and signing in the following order:

1. If `LRSQL_KEY_FILE` specifies a valid keystore on disk, it will be used.
2. If `LRSQL_KEY_PKEY_FILE` and `LRSQL_KEY_CERT_CHAIN` specificy valid PEM files on disk, an in-memory keystore will be created and used based on their contents.
3. If no keystore or cert files are found, lrsql will create a self-signed cert and log a warning.

### Generating Dev Certs with `mkcert`

If you install [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) you can generate stable valid certs to use while developing the app:

``` shell

$ cp "$(mkcert -CAROOT)"/rootCA.pem config/cacert.pem
$ mkcert -key-file config/server.key.pem \
         -cert-file config/server.crt.pem \
         example.com "*.example.com" example.test localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
$ clojure -Mdb-h2 -m lrsql.h2.main
...
11:25:54.085 [main] INFO  lrsql.util.cert - Generated keystore from key and cert(s)...

```
