A SQL-based Learning Record Store.

## What is SQL LRS?

A Learning Record Store (LRS) is a persistent store for xAPI statements and associated attachments and documents. The full LRS specification can be found in Part 3 of the [xAPI specification](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md). SQL LRS is distinct from other LRSs developed at Yet Analytics for being SQL-based and supporting multiple SQL database management systems (DBMSs) like H2, SQLite, and Postgres.
