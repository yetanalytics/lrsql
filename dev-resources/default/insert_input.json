        "en" : "A profile derived from the xAPI Video CoP profile, scoped to the TC3 CUF HC content available from the deployed medicine website, and designed for programmatic generation of sensible, dense, and diverse xAPI datasets; datasets which include a multitude of emergent, reasonable, and repeatable patterns of behavior; behavior modeled within the TCCC CUF HC xAPI Profile as statement templates and patterns.\n\nThe xAPI Video CoP profile was chosen as a starting point for many reasons including:\n\n1) it's the prevailing effort to model the video domain within the xAPI ecosystem\n2) it has gone through several iterations, i.e., v1.0.3\n\nThe CoP, led by Pankaj Agrawal and full of talented xAPI community members, has conversed, debated, and pondered the design of the xAPI Video CoP profile since the groups formation. Their work is extremely valuable and serves as the shoulders upon which the current profile resides. Sadly, the TCCC CUF HC xAPI Profile statement templates no longer conform to the constraints of their ancestors - for several reasons; future work may alter this. As such, statements conformant to the TCCC CUF HC xAPI Profile are not required to include a reference to the CoP xAPI Video profile. Regardless, the influence of the xAPI Video CoP profile is found throughout this document.\n\nThe TCCC CUF HC xAPI Profiles' design enables an xAPI semantic modeling technique that currently the xAPI Video CoP profile does not. Using the v1.0.3 xAPI Video CoP profile as the basis for programmatic, xAPI profile based, statement generation -- via pattern and statement template definitions -- results in little more than noise and logical fallacies sandwiched in between video initializations and terminations. The CoP profile, along with other similar, low granularity, low complexity xAPI profiles; profiles which do not model --- well, generically and/or otherwise --- permutations of behavioral patterns; patterns implicit to the domains being modeled by the profiles; are not good candidates as they don't accurately reflect the domain they model, both as defined using xAPI and as demonstrated through xAPI profile based statement generation.\n\nThe authors of this profile understand that xAPI profiles can be intentionally designed in a way which is contextually rich and well designed, yet not appropriate as the basis for statement generation. The authors take no issue with intentful design, but are also quick to point out that inaccurate, inconsistent, misleading, and/or incorrect semantic modeling of a domain -- as an xAPI profile -- can be quickly identified within the trends, statements, and general characteristics of corresponding simulated xAPI datasets.\n\nModel based data generation prevents poorly designed models from hiding -- as well -- behind the curtain of JSON-LD. This detection is contingent upon sufficient analysis of the simulation datasets as the analysis precedes understanding of a models properties and nuances. In some cases, that analysis consists of stepping through activity logs, while in other cases it involves filtering, transformation, aggregation, and/or visualization of xAPI data in order to describe some aspect of the model; and thus hopefully the real world. If a complex, domain specific, data generating processes can be replicated within simulation results via xAPI profile definitions, the pattern matching construct responsible can be utilized in a number of ways including:\n\na) continuous refinement and testing on novel datasets, i.e. tuning\nb) data mining tasks once the corresponding model is tuned\nc) KPI tracking or another live, event based form of tracking; can be implemented within streaming architectures or other information digital highways\nd) additional ways not envisioned by the authors\n\nThe power of the generative technique lies in a positive feedback loop established by, and implicit to, iterative xAPI profile design when equipped with a tool that provides a means of easy experimentation and rapid prototyping. The ability to incorporate elements from real world datasets into this feedback loop strengthens the semantic domain modeling processes. The process of incorporating new sources of information into, and deriving data driven insights from these data sources can be automated in ways which promote and/or support autonomous refinement and background services such as anomalous pattern identification.\n\nIn general, xAPI profiles written for use within generation should contain:\n\n1) patterns complex enough to enable programmatic generation of sensible xAPI learner pathways\n   a) in the case of video; simple played, paused, resumed, and completed logic to prevent obvious logical fallacies in generated datasets\n   b) diverse patterns which model a sufficient number of domain specific behavioral patterns and/or permutations within said patterns\n\n2) high and low level statement templates\n   a) definition of patterns common to a classification of things, i.e. statement templates with a low to medium amount of granularity or specificity\n   b) definition of patterns specific to a thing, the classification of which may not be a factor, i.e. statement templates with a medium to high amount of granularity or specificity\n\nThis xAPI Profile is currently (2/20/2020) limited to interactions with TCCC CUF HC video content but this document may be returned to at a later date for additional work. Future work may expand upon the other phases -- i.e., 1, 3 and 4 -- and components -- e.g. TCCC ASM, Combat Casualty Care, etc. -- from the expanded TCCC universe. Major updates to this profile will be documented and handled in adherence to the xAPI Profile Specification and general best practices.\n\nIn closing, the current effort resulted in the derivation of non-trivial behavioral pathways, within the domain of video engagements, from the set of possible video interactions established by the CoP xAPI Video profile. These pathways are written in the abstract language of xAPI patterns and statement templates but are made more concrete through the incorporation of TCCC CUF HC video content. The videos themselves are defined as concepts where as the possible video interactions are defined as patterns that reference statement templates specific to said videos. This profile improves upon the Video CoP xAPI profile by providing an expansion of the video interaction behavior permutations, expressed as xAPI profile patterns. The expansion enables generation of datasets which will eventually pass some sniff test provided enough tuning and refinement of the definitions within this profile. In comparison, the dataset generated by the Video CoP xAPI profile is blown out of the water in terms of complexity, usefulness, and sensibility which is unexpected given the differences between the two xAPI profiles."
