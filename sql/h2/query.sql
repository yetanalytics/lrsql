/* The strategy of `query-statements` is to use multiple joins to form a
   Cartesian product over statements, agents, and activities:
   
     (stmt, stmt_desc, stmt_actor, stmt_desc_actor, stmt_activity, stmt_desc_activity)
   
   Because we only want to return properties of `stmt`, which may be identical
   across multiple such tuples, we apply SELECT DISTINCT at the top level.
*/

/* `id` (the primary key) is a SQUUID with guarenteed monotonicity. This is
   important for the following:
   - As a cursor to the next page of query results when `limit` is applied.
     `id` thus must always be sequential; otherwise, for instance, new
     statements may be inserted mid-page instead of appended.
   - As a secondary sort property for query results; we cannot only apply
     `stored` as the only property since it only has millisecond resolution,
     which is not good enough for deterministic results. */
