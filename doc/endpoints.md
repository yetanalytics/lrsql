# HTTP Endpoints

The HTTP methods that are LRS-specific are given in [the xAPI spec](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#datatransfer). Requests to the LRS (which are denoted by the `xapi` path prefix) must contain a Base64 encoded, colon-separated public and secret API key pair in the `Authorization` field of the header. For example (assuming `http://example` is the URL body), `http://example.org/xapi/statements` is the URL at which the user inserts and queries xAPI statements; other URLs are used to insert and query documents, agents, and activities.

### Admin Account and Credential Routes

In addition to the LRS HTTP methods, the SQL LRS supports methods for admin account creation, login, and use, as well as routes used to create and use API ; these methods are denoted by the `admin` path prefix.

The following examples use `http://example.org` as the URL body. All methods return `200 OK` on success. All routes except for `account/login` and `admin/env` must contain a JSON Web Token (JWT), generated by account creation or login, in the `Authorization` header in the form of `Bearer [JWT]`; if the JWT is expired or invalid a `401 UNAUTHORIZED` is returned. All methods also require that the request body be a JSON object, though the permitted values depend on the route; invalid request bodies will result a `400 BAD REQUEST` error. If an error is encountered, these routes return a JSON object in the body like the following:

```json
{
    "error": "[error message]"
}
```

#### Admin Account Routes

- `POST http://example.org/admin/account/login`: Log into an existing account. The request body must be a JSON object that contains `username` and `password` strings. These must conform to the following requirements:
  * `username` must be a minimum of 7 characters.
  * `password` must be a minimum of 10 characters.
  * `password` must contain at least one lower case character.
  * `password` must contain at least one upper case character.
  * `password` must contain at least one numeric character.
  * `password` must contain at least one of the following special characters: `!@#$%^&*_-+=?`.

The response body contains a newly generated JSON Web Token (JWT) on success. A `401 UNAUTHORIZED` status code is returned if the credentials are incorrect.
- `POST http://example.org/admin/account/create`: Create a new admin account. The request body must be a JSON object that contains `username` and `password` strings. The endpoint returns a JSON object with the ID (UUID) of the newly created user on success, and returns a `409 CONFLICT` if the account already exists.
- `DELETE http://example.org/admin/account`: Delete an existing account. The JSON request body must contain a UUID `account-id` value. The endpoint returns a JSON object with the ID of the deleted account on success and returns a `404 NOT FOUND` error if the account does not exist.
- `GET http://example.org/admin/account`: Return an array of all admin accounts in the system on success.
- `GET http://example.org/admin/me`: Returns the currently authenticated admin accounts on success.

#### Admin Credential Routes

- `POST http://example.org/admin/creds`: Create a new credential pair, with the specified scope values given by the `scopes` property in the request body.
- `PUT http://example.org/admin/creds`: Update an existing credential pair, given by `api-key` and `secret-key` properties in the request body, with the new scopes given by the `scopes` property.
- `GET http://example.org/admin/creds`: Read all credential pairs and their associated scopes for a particular account (denoted by the JWT).
- `DELETE http://example.org/admin/creds`: Delete an existing credential pair, given by the `api-key` and `secret-key` properties in the request body, as well as any associated scopes.

#### Misc Admin Routes

- `GET http://example.org/admin/env`: Get select environment variables about the configuration which may aid in client-side operations. Currently returns a map containing the configuration variables `urlPrefix` and `enableStmtHtml`.
- `DELETE http://example.org/admin/agents`: Runs a *hard delete* of all records of an actor, and associated records (statements, attachments, etc).  Intended for privacy purposes like GDPR.  Body should be a JSON object of form `{"actor-ifi":<actor-ifi>}`.  Disabled unless the configuration variable enableAdminDeleteActor to be set to `true`.

### Reaction Management Routes

If [Reactions](reactions.md) are enabled, the following routes can be used to manage them:

- `POST http://example.org/admin/reaction`: Create a new reaction by providing a JSON `ruleset` and `active` boolean. On success returns 200 with the `reactionId` of the new reaction.
- `GET http://example.org/admin/reaction`: List all reactions, active and inactive.
- `PUT http://example.org/admin/reaction`: Given a `reactionId` and either a JSON `ruleset` or boolean `active` parameter, update the given reaction. On success returns 200 with the `reactionId` of the updated reaction. Returns 404 if the reaction is not found.
- `DELETE http://example.org/admin/reaction`: Delete a reaction specified by `reactionId`. Returns 200 with the `reactionId` of the deleted reaction on success or 404 if not found.
